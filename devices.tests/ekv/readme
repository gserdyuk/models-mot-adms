EKV compariosn resulst

1) compared at dc to ngspice
graphically can not see any difference
very good coincides

2) compared to reference data from ekv site
results differ (very minor, but differ)
graphically visible, difference is about 1%
cvan be explained by model code difference 
(verilog codes at site and at ngspice repo are differents)

3) golden
contains referemce data, which were checked manually (see comparison)

4) comparison
contains data obtained from other simulations, manual comparisons by gnuplot
