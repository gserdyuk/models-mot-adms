GNUVCAP MOT-ADMS

I. Introduction
---------------
This package contains verilog-a models from NG-Spice-20 and other 
sources and transformation  scripts made by Laurent Lemaitre for 
ngspice package.

GNUCAP can handle NGSPICE models via spice-wrapper.cc; this package 
contains compiled models and compilation scripts/procedures. 

II. Directory structure
-----------------------
Include     - necessary include fiels from NGSPICE
admst       - mot-adms scrips to generate ngspice model; gnucap has 
              wrapper which allows usage of ngspice models.
devices.tests - tests for models
ekv
hicum0
hicum2
mextram
psp102      - verilog-a models

III. Licensing - TBD
--------------------
NGSPICE says:
"
The models are licensed under Berkeley's license.  See the file
COPYING for details.  Note that this is not GPL.
"

The "Include" directory contains files from NG-spice. 

IV. Molde Modifications
-----------------------

There are no modifications to any of the model code, other than to add
a "Makefile" and "wrapper.h" for each one, except for a bug fix in vbic.

V. Model testing
----------------
They have been minimally tested.  Most of the semiconductor models
appear to work.  Minimal testing means that one or two tests were run
on some of them, and they appear to give believable reslts.  A few
tests were run comparing to references supplied by Berkeley, and the
results match within set tolerances.

VI. BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
Copy in the same directory as the gnucap source.

Link package to gnucap sources:
  > cd gnucap-mot-adms
  >ln -s <gnucap-directory>/src Gnucap

If you are building with a compiler other than gcc and g++, you will
need to change the "Make2" file.  If you are cross-compiling with
mingw, update the "Make2" symlink to point to "Make2.mingw".  For
anything else, delete the symlink and make a new "Make2" as a copy of
"Make2.gcc", and edit the copy to your needs.

The Makefile supports only "make all" and "make clean".  It doesn't
yet install.  

When you run "make", it builds a ".so" file in each directory.  These
can be placed anywhere that is convenient.  You can use them in gnucap
with the "attach" command.  If there are no slashes in the name, it
uses the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to locate them.  If the
name has a slash, the usual rules for finding files apply.

To install, you can copy the ".so" files to where you want them.

VII. Add own models
